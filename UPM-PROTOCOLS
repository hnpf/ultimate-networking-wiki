               ###   The Internet Protocol Versions (IPV4, 5, 6 & Beyond)



        ###  IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) – THE CLASSIC



    Introduced in 1981 (still the most common today)

    Uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1)

    Supports 4.3 billion unique addresses (but we ran out 🥲)

    Uses NAT (Network Address Translation) to "extend" address space

    Supports unicast, broadcast, and multicast

    Problem: It’s not enough for the modern internet



        ###  IPv5 (INEXISTENT but kinda real ) – THE LOST ONE



    Never officially released as a public internet protocol

    It was an experimental streaming protocol called ST (Internet Stream Protocol)

    Designed for real-time voice & video (but never took off)

    People skipped it because it was just a prototype, and they went straight to IPv6

    That’s why there’s NO IPv5 in public use today!!



        ###  IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) – THE FUTURE



    Introduced in 1998 to fix IPv4’s address shortage

    Uses 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:db8::1)

    Supports 340 undecillion (that’s 340 followed by 36 zeros) unique addresses

    Built-in security (IPSec), no more NAT needed

    Supports auto-configuration (no more DHCP required!)

    Slowly replacing IPv4, but adoption is still meh



        ###  IPv7, 8, 9+?? (Rumors & Research)



    There is NO official IPv7, IPv8, or IPv9 yet

    Some universities & military projects have tested experimental next-gen internet protocols

    China announced "IPv9" but it was mostly hype

    Most future networking projects focus on enhancing IPv6 instead of making a whole new version



        ###  Related Internet Addressing Protocols & Concepts




        ###  CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) – FIXED THE OLD SYSTEM



    Replaced the old Class A, B, C system (which wasted IPs)

    Uses subnet masks like 192.168.1.0/24 to efficiently divide networks

    Helps with routing, scaling, and conserving IP addresses



        ###  NAT (Network Address Translation) – HIDING PRIVATE IPS



    Allows multiple devices to share one public IP

    Used in home routers (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x)

    Necessary because IPv4 ran out of addresses

    Downside: Breaks some protocols & requires workarounds for peer-to-peer stuff



        ###  CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT) – THE ISP NIGHTMARE



    ISPs use this when they don’t have enough IPv4 addresses

    Multiple users share one public IP (which can cause issues with gaming, VPNs, security, etc.)

    Slows down adoption of IPv6 (since ISPs just hoard IPv4)



        ###  IPX/SPX (Novell’s Old IP Alternative) – DEAD BUT COOL



    Used in Novell NetWare (an old networking OS)

    It was faster than IP in small networks but didn’t scale well

    Killed off when TCP/IP became the global standard



        ###  DECnet (Digital’s Internet Rival) – ALSO DEAD



    Used by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)

    Competed with TCP/IP in the 80s but lost

    Had cool self-configuring network features that inspired modern IP protocols



        ###  AppleTalk (Apple’s Old Networking Protocol) – FORGOTTEN



    Used for Mac-to-Mac communication in the 80s & 90s

    Designed to be plug-and-play (no configuration needed)

    Replaced by TCP/IP in the early 2000s



        ###  IPvFoo (Fun Fact Protocol :))



    There's a browser extension called IPvFoo that shows if websites use IPv4 or IPv6

    Helps see if a site is actually using the new internet or still stuck in the past
